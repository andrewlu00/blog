Hi there! My name is Andrew, and I am currently a first-year undergraduate student at Harvard University. I
graduated from Westwood High School in May 2018. My academic interests are math and computer science, specifically
the realm of theoretical computer science. I hope to one day conduct research into algorithms and optimization
theory.

My favorite leisure activity is playing chess. I love the game because it involves two people with opposite goals
coming together to create a work of art. I've been playing competitively for ten years now, and I've reached the
status of National Master after several thousand hours of studying and training. In addition to chess, I enjoy
playing piano, basketball, and Hearthstone.

Reading books is one of the activities besides chess that I try my hardest to keep up with. I find it very important
to expand my horizons and learn from creative and well-rounded thinkers. My favorite books of all time are
<i>The Pale King</i> by David Foster Wallace and <i>The God of Small Things</i> by Arundhati Roy.
